# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add disaster crash tracking system with multiple aircraft support and severity warning filter.

**Planned changes:**
- Add disaster crash indicator and multiple aircraft tracking to crash records
- Require source verification for submitting disaster crashes with multiple aircraft
- Add "Show Disaster Crashes" toggle filter that defaults to hiding disaster crashes
- Display severity warning modal when users first enable disaster crash filter
- Show disaster crash badges and detailed aircraft information in crash list and details panel

**User-visible outcome:** Users can track crashes involving multiple aircraft as disaster crashes (only with verified sources), filter them with a toggle that shows a severity warning on first use, and view detailed information about each aircraft involved in disaster crashes.
